# Multivariate Data Analysis of CO2 Emissions 
- A project with Martin Blasi and Carles Manchado

- The aim of this project is to gain insight into the distribution of CO2 emissions worldwide by finding country-level clusters

Current To Dos:
In week 14.11-18.11
- Descriptive statistics on CO2/gdp data (n>200) - switch to per capita
- get gdp per capita data

Until week 21.11-25.11
- Merge with GPS data (limited on N=76) 
- Merge with climate pledges
- Get global data on energy taxes (maybe also energy prices for separate analysis)
- Merge all - run PCAs, Biplots
- Get ideas for clustering
