Belgium,Overview,Summary of Commitment,,,lts_target,"Belgium’s LTS is composed of three separate regional strategies (Walloon, Flemish, and Bruxelles-Capitale), which collectively cover the entire party’s emissions profile. The Walloon strategy “aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050”; the Flemish strategy “aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from sectors not covered by ETS (so-called non-ETS sectors) by 85% [from a 2005 baseline] by 2050, with the ambition to evolve towards total climate neutrality”; and the Bruxelles-Capitale [strategy] aims to “[get] closer [to] the European objective of carbon neutrality by 2050.”",LTS,Quantified Long-term Emissions Goal
